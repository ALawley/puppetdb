### Preparing for PuppetDB 3.0

With the upcoming 3.0 major release of PuppetDB, the v2 and v3 query APIs will
be retired and the v4 API will be the only one that remains. Users developing
against PuppetDB's query API are encouraged to refer to the
[upgrading guide in our master branch](https://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppetdb/master/api/query/v4/upgrading-from-v3.html)
to stay up to date on the changes planned. Note that this document is not in
its final state, and will continue to be updated as the release approaches.
