## Resource Statuses

PE PuppetDB stores resources status from both unchanged and changed resources
from a Puppet report and surfaces that information via the [`/reports`][reports]
endpoint via a new `resources` field.

This feature will require additional disk space on your PostgreSQL instance.

For information about configuration of unchanged resources in reports, see the
[`terminus configuration section`][terminus].
