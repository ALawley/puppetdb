## Can I migrate my data from ActiveRecord storeconfigs?

Yes, but you must use PuppetDB 3.x to do so. Please consult the
[PuppetDB 3.x documentiation][puppetdb3] for more details.

## Can I migrate from an existing PuppetDB to a new instance?

Yes. See [Migrating Data][migrating] for more information.

## The PuppetDB dashboard gives me a weird SSL error when I visit it. What gives?

There are two common error cases with the dashboard:

* You're trying to talk over plaintext (8080) and PuppetDB's not listening

By default, PuppetDB only listens for plaintext connections on localhost, for
security reasons. In order to talk to it this way, you'll need to either
forward the plaintext port or change the interface PuppetDB binds on to one
that is accessible from the outside world. In the latter case, you'll want to
use some other means to secure PuppetDB (for instance, by restricting which
hosts are allowed to talk to PuppetDB through a firewall).

* You're trying to talk over SSL and nobody trusts anybody else

Because PuppetDB uses the certificate authority of your Puppet
infrastructure, and a certificate signed by it, PuppetDB doesn't trust your
browser, and your browser doesn't trust PuppetDB. In this case, you'll need to
give your browser a certificate signed by your Puppet CA. Support for client
certificates is varied between browsers, so it's preferred to connect over
plaintext, as outlined above.

## Does PuppetDB support Puppet apply?

Yes. The setup is quite different to the normal master based setup, so
[consult the documentation][connect_puppet_apply] for more details.

## Why is PuppetDB written in Java?

Actually, PuppetDB isn't written in Java at all! It's written in a language
called Clojure, which is a dialect of Lisp that runs on the Java Virtual
Machine. Several other languages were prototyped, including Ruby and JRuby, but
they lacked the necessary performance.  We chose to use a JVM language because
of its excellent libraries and high performance. Of the available JVM
languages, we used Clojure because of its expressiveness, performance, and
previous experience with the language on our team.

## Which versions of Java are supported?

The officially supported versions are OpenJDK and Oracle JDK 1.7 on
Debian-derived distros and 1.8 on RHEL-derived distros. Other versions may work
and issues will be addressed on a best effort basis, but support is not guaranteed.

## Which databases are supported?

PostgreSQL is the recommended database for production use. PuppetDB also ships
with an embedded HyperSQL database which is suitable for very small or proof of
concept deployments. As with our choice of language, we prototyped several
databases before settling on PostgreSQL. These included Neo4j, Riak, and MySQL
with ActiveRecord in Ruby. We have no plans to support any other databases,
including MySQL, which lacks important features such as array columns and
recursive queries.

## I may have a corrupt KahaDB store. What does this mean, what causes it and how can I recover?

If PuppetDB throws an exception while the application starts or while receiving
a command it may be due to KahaDB corruption. The exception generally has some
mention of the KahaDB libraries (org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb), for example:

    java.io.EOFException
        at java.io.RandomAccessFile.readInt(RandomAccessFile.java:776)
        at org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.disk.journal.DataFileAccessor.readRecord(DataFileAccessor.java:81)

You should consult the [Troubleshooting guide for Kahadb][trouble_kahadb] for
details on how to rememdy this.

## PuppetDB daemon shuts down, with a "Cannot assign requested address" error. What does this mean, and how do I fix it?

~~~
FAILED org.eclipse.jetty.server.Server@6b2c636d: java.net.BindException: Cannot assign requested address
java.net.BindException: Cannot assign requested address
~~~

PuppetDB will error with this message if the IP address associated with the ssl-host parameter in the
jetty.ini isn't linked to a known interface - or resolvable.

## Why is the load so high on the database server?

There could be many reasons for a high load on the database server.
The total number of nodes managed by Puppet, the frequency of the
agent runs, the amount of changes to the nodes on each run etc. One
possible cause of execessive load on the database server is a low
catalog duplication rate. See the [PuppetDB dashboard][maintaining_tuning]
to find this rate for your PuppetDB instance. If this rate is
significantly lower than 90%, see [Why is my catalog duplication rate so low?](#why-is-my-catalog-duplication-rate-so-low).

## Why is my catalog duplication rate so low?

The catalog duplication rate can be found on the
[dashboard][maintaining_tuning]. Typically that percentage should be
90% or above. If that percentage is lower, it could cause a much
heavier I/O load on the database. Refer to the [Troubleshooting Low
Catalog Duplication guide][low_catalog_dupe] for steps to diagnose the
problem.

## My puppet master is going slow since enabling PuppetDB. How can I profile it?

In Puppet 3.x a new profiling capability was introduced that we have leveraged in the PuppetDB termini client code. By simply adding `profile=true` to your `puppet.conf` you can enable detailed profiling of all apsects of Puppet including the PuppetDB termini. For this to work you must enable debugging on your master instance as well.

Of course use your common sense, any profiling mechanism will add more load which can increase your problems when you already have limited capacity. Enabling profiling in production should only be done with care and for a very short amount of time.

All PuppetDB profiling events are prefixed with `PuppetDB:` so can by easily searched for. This information is helpful to our developers to debug performance issues also, so feel free to include these details when raising tickets against PuppetDB.
